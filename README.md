### Project Desc:

A* (A-Star), is a pathfinding algorithem that computes the shortest distance between two points in a world space using the "manhatten-distance" heuristic. 

Here is a youtube video to explain it quickly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71CEj4gKDnE

On a 2-D plane within the Godot Engine, the goal of this project was to create a graphical representation of the A* algorithem finding that shortest path between two points and you get to watch it do that!
